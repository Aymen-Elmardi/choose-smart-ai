Gated merges, each shipped on its own from main after the owner's "GO M<id>".

### M5a (merged 2026-10-20)

DEPLOY M5a | 2026-10-20 | commit 60906ee
URLs to request indexing (full https URLs, one per line):
https://chosepayments.com/insights/source-of-funds
Redirects added (301):
https://chosepayments.com/insights/why-payment-providers-ask-for-source-of-funds -> https://chosepayments.com/insights/source-of-funds
What changed:
- /insights/source-of-funds: 7 sections folded in from the old page (H1, title, meta and existing copy unchanged).
- /insights/visa-mastercard-control-card-payments, /insights, /insights/guides, /insights/graph: link or list entry for the old URL updated or removed (not worth an indexing request).
Next deploy not before: 2026-10-21 (1 to 2 days later).
Post-deploy checks (2026-10-20): first production run failed on a transient next/font Google Fonts fetch; re-run passed. Old URL 301 -> target in one hop (also with trailing slash, .html, query string, www); target 200, self canonical, no noindex, new sections live; sitemap 124 URLs without the old one; every other sitemap URL unchanged vs work/baseline-onpage.csv apart from the three list pages.
Watch for 14 days: /insights/source-of-funds clicks and position vs work/baseline-onpage.csv and the GSC baseline; propose a revert if clicks fall more than 25% with stable impressions.

### M5b (GO M5b pre-approved for 2026-10-21; prepared and merged 2026-10-21)

What changed:
- /insights/rolling-vs-fixed-reserve (ranking page, additive only): 4 sections folded in from the old page before the closing Key Takeaway; H1, title, meta and existing sections unchanged; "how to negotiate reserves" now jumps to the new section on the page.
- Six articles' links, the /insights/compliance card and the Insights hub list now point to the target or drop the old entry (not worth an indexing request).
Next deploy not before: 1 to 2 days after the merge date.
Watch for 14 days: /insights/rolling-vs-fixed-reserve clicks and position (it ranks around 3.5); propose a revert if clicks fall more than 25% with stable impressions.
